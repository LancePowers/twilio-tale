group project working together on list of ideas. Each idea

paramaters get set one side only sees functions ~ one side knows what it needs, the other side has to provide it., refactor return their code
cannot not answer a function. Have to provide a variable for each paramater. All variables and function calls go on a small white board. Once game starts person/function
has to do their function, but nothing more. no talking. step 1 split into 3 explain to each group what they are responsible for. They don't know what any of the other
parts are doing. Coding completes and instructor() is called to translate the variable names. Game is run. error-message where it breaks. ?debugger where class can choose to rerun any part!
Can we refactor in the table groups alone? If not instructor can facilitate a quick class discussion. After running Refactor to minimum interdependencies. Stretch to refactor
for bigger board. Third Player. ?Break off group for AI!
